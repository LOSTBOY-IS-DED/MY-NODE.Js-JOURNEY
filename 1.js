console.log("Hello there I am subh ");

// we can run this file by command node <filename> 

// console.log(window); // this will give error 
// why this is happening that some of the features of window are not working on node.js ?
// this is because all the features of DOM and window objects are not included in node js
// features like file handle and cryptography has been included its not its not just that they included what ever they wanted

// whenever we wanna start a project we need to do npm init
//  npm stands for node package manager
